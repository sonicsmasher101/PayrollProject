Initial Project Proposal
	This program is going to provide an employer to keep track of the hours worked by each employee, as well as calculate the pay for each and every employee. The program allows for workers to login, and then logout once they are done working for the day. However, after eight hours, if the worker hasnâ€™t yet logged out, they will be automatically be logged out of the system. When an employee is logged out, the system keeps track of the number of hours that have passed since the login time. This time is them kept track of in a file containing the worked time for all of the employees.The admin can then access the file and calculate the pay for the workers. 

Requirements:
Employee login system, utilizing ID and name, which should
Be able to handle multiple employees at the same time
Admin login, using password
Separate login areas for admin and employee login, so the admin only needs to use the admin login
Admin needs to be able to
Add employees to the system
Remove employees from the system
Set and edit hourly pay for the employees
Calculate pay for each worker after each week of work
Employee logout system, which should
Calculate and print out time between login time and logout time
Store time worked for each employee in a way that the admin can access
Automatically logout employee after 8 hours if they forget to logout and notify them the next time they log in
	
Initial Design
Employee class that has instance fields First Name, Last Name, ID number, Login Time, Logout Time
Admin class, which has methods to add/remove employees from system
Both employee and admin classes will implement an interface worker
Worker contains unimplemented login method
Employee has methods to login, and to logout, which keep track of the time when called
Logout method saves time worked to file for admin
Employee method to check whether or not 8 hours have passed, and if true, log out the employee, tracking time worked as well
